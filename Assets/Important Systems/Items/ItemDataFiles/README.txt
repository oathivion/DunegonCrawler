Follow the format I set up when adding an item. If you don't I will find you + you could break the deserializer.
Keep the items you're adding to the right file
    *ArmorData is for making Armor
    *WeaponData is for Weapons
    *ConsumableData is for Potions and the such
    *MiscItemData is for things that just exist to sell
    ?If we want to do resources so people can craft things and such I can add that
    !DO NOT REMOVE DEV{ITEM TYPE} OR FILLER FOR THE TIME BEING THOSE WILL BE FOR TESTING!
